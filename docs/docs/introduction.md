## Overview

This is the behind-the-scenes look at my personal portfolio website where I showcase my software development projects.

## What's under the hood?

I built this site using Go for the backend and Svelte for the frontend. Why these choices? Well, I went with Go because it's performant and it's a language I'm comfortable with. As for Svelte, I wanted to try something new on the frontend side.

### Backend (Go)

The Go backend provides API endpoints, handles data processing.

### Frontend (Svelte)

Svelte serves as the frontend framework, offering a component-based architecture with minimal runtime overhead. Unlike traditional frameworks, Svelte shifts much of the work to compile time, meaning highly optimized JavaScript that runs in the browser.

## Repository Structure

You'll find both high-level overviews and detailed technical specs throughout these docs. I've broken everything down by topics like development setup and architecture, so you can easily find what you're looking for.

## Intended Audience

- Developers interested in the technical implementation details
- Potential collaborators who may contribute to the codebase

## Version Information
